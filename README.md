### Purpose

Microsimulation and agent-based models are increasingly being used to simulate complex social systems and to understand everyday interaction networks. However, accurate microsimulation models require comprehensive network datasets that combine large-scale network structures with detailed individual-level behavioral characteristics. Our project focuses on two main objectives:

1. Generate synthetic networks that are statistically and structurally equivalent to an existing sociocentric network dataset from Portland, Oregon using the Iterative Local Expansion method.
2. Perform network fusion by combining the synthetically generated dataset with egocentric network survey data to create a comprehensive social network.

The ultimate aim of this project is to further researcherâ€™s ability to generate complex and comprehensive graph network datasets for populations of interest for the purpose of improving social simulations like those in disease transmission.

### What We Do

- **Generation:** Create synthetic networks that match the statistical and structural properties of an existing sociocentric dataset.
- **Fusion:** Combine synthetic and egocentric network data to form a detailed and comprehensive social network.

### How to Use this Repository

- Refer to the README files in fusion_software and generation_software.
